print("""PROBLEM 1: 

    We have several additional parsing definitions which apply to
    segments of csv file (from start line to end line).
    
    We can import these defintions as in *more_def* , but they are never
    used in containers.py when parsing table headers.

    When dealing with segments of csv file, only a single parsing definition 
    aplies to a segment, it is either main spec or some additional spec.

    For previous implementatoin see SegmentState class in 
    https://github.com/epogrebnyak/data-rosstat-kep/blob/master/kep/reader/reader.py#L29-L85
    
        SegmentState(default_spec, other_specs).assign_segments(heads)

    was used to assign parsing definition to each segment.
    
    Maybe in containers.py we can also walk by table headers and assing a parsing
    definition to each table.
