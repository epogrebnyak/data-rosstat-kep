- full testsuite

3:53 01.01.1970
- early check for duplicates
- new emitter
- turn back to startswith 
- general flow in realease.py

Done:
sphinx-apidoc -F -M -f -o docs src/kep

Notes:
- may use class attributes as .attrib notation, but this is wtf
- why nosetests is used in PyCharm as default?


    # NEXT:
    # import_several_specs.py
    # Remove reader.py (leave todos/requirements + some code in 'main' in this module)
    # Compare pdef unique varname heads to Datapoints varname heads
    #     - Datapoints varname heads
    #     - pdef unique varname heads
    #     - print both
    #     - diff on list
    #     - find in file
    #     - decide why not imported +  fix specs? 
    #     - think of test
    # Pdef issues
    # More tabs issues
    # Guide to code review

REQUIREMENTS
(1) release all values from d.emit('a') and test them against  *testpoints_valid* 
    *FIXME - fialing unittest
        kep\parser\test_containers.py F
         kep\parser\test_datapoints.py FFF
(2) control there are no varnames with same value and year/month/quarter 
    *DONE through emitter.HasValues
(3) make sure all labels from ParsingDefinition(specfile_path) are read, at least at some frequency 
    *DONE in Datapoints.not_imported()
(4) every variable from specs has a *testpoints_valid* 
    

REMEDIES
# - merge some specs to increase coverage - see what is total numer of headers
# - run headers check against each other - see if checks can work on different header
# - restore mechanism to apply parsing definitions to segments of file
# - add more elements to testpoints_valid
