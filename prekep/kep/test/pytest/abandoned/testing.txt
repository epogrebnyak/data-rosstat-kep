Current testing status:
- pytest folder updated by https://github.com/epogrebnyak/rosstat-kep-data/commit/5e67f6dc836c02f59bac468be7c207eddac41a38
  changed spec format + replaced specification test
- I cannot modify unittests as fast as I can work with pytest -> pytest remains working test suit
- unittests now would not work as they reply on depreciated format of spec files (now spec files have two sections, not three)

Achievements:
- test_common_specification.py now test for real-world configuration files with several segments + spec file format simplified + some old tests depreciated
  https://github.com/epogrebnyak/rosstat-kep-data/blob/master/kep/test/pytest/_modules/file_io/test_common_specification.py

Problems:
1. tests have too many (3 sets) of testable data created at different times with different intent, need to harmonise them:
  - conftest.py - formerly 'hardcoded.py'
  - test_mwe.py - something for the least possible end-to-end test
  - test_common_specification.py - has newer version of conftest.py/hardcoded.py or part of it
  I prefer two latest datasets, but conftest.py may also have useful stuff.  
  
  Testable data is sorted by following categories (can be seen in test_mwe.py):
  - raw data + as files
  - spec/cfg + as files
  - imported raw data
  - labelled_rows
  - stream of flat data
  - dataframes

   issue: https://github.com/epogrebnyak/rosstat-kep-data/issues/79
 
2. test_label_csv.py does not its own job, it is actuall a test of import of conftest.py data up to labelled rows
   in essence it shoulds do only something like https://github.com/epogrebnyak/rosstat-kep-data/blob/master/kep/test/pytest/_package/test_mwe.py#L146-L147
   the rest of file is about importing data, this is tested elsewhere
   they have a useful function that checks all files are present 

```
def test_import(raw_data_file, spec_file, cfg_file):
    assert os.path.exists(raw_data_file)
    assert os.path.exists(spec_file)
    assert os.path.exists(cfg_file)
```
   issue: https://github.com/epogrebnyak/rosstat-kep-data/issues/80
   test_label_csv.py must not depend on fixtures, must test labelling only, import should be covered in different tests

3. issues about database versions is filled, but this is low priority for now - untill we get back to unittests

4. example_*.py not covered by tests. issue filled.
